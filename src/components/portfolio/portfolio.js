Users can create planning boards, or maps as we call them, where an unlimited amount of guests can be invited to suggest or vote on plans within user-customized trip catergories (e.g. Resturants, Accommodation, Hikes, Entertainment etc.) The app makes group consensus clear with visual outputs for voting stats and a print itinerary function that ranks the leading suggestions at any given time. Along with a chat room unique to each map, communicating has never been more accessible and centralized. Whether you are trying coordinate plans with a group or are just having fun dreaming about your next vacation, planning a trip has never been easier or as stress free! PLANiT - connecting our world to your plan! PLANiT uses a React.js front end, along with MongoDB to create a robust, full MERN application. Tools and packages that were used to make this application possible include socket.io, nodemailer, react-scroll, react-animate-on-scroll, ant-design, axios, and more. The team has plans to integrate more APIs and features to make PLANiT a travel-prep must-have!"
